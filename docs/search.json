    "text": "World Development Indicators - USA vs Turkey: Exploratory Data Analysis\n\nIntroduction:\nIn this Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), we focused on the years 2018 to 2023, we conducted a comparative analysis between two countries, Ukraine and Turkey, both aspiring to become candidates for the European Union. Utilizing key indicators such as total population, GDP per capita, age dependency ratio, inflation, unemployment rate, and gender-specific labor force participation rates, we aimed to evaluate and contrast the socio-economic landscapes of these nations. The data collected from the World Bank allows us to gain insights into the demographic structure, economic performance, and labor dynamics, providing a comprehensive overview of the key factors influencing their candidacy for EU membership. This analysis will contribute to a deeper understanding of the current state and potential trajectories of Ukraine and Turkey in their pursuit of EU accession.\n\n\nDescription of Selected Indicators:\n\nTotal Population:\n\nTotal population is the sum of all residents regardless of age.\n\n\n\nGDP per Capita:\n\nGross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita represents the average economic output per person.\n\n\n\nAge Dependency Ratio:\n\nThe age dependency ratio is the ratio of dependents (those aged 0-14 and 65+) to the working-age population (15-64).\n\n\n\nInflation, Consumer Prices (CPI) Annual Growth Rate:\n\nThe Consumer Price Index (CPI) measures the average change over time in the prices paid by urban consumers for a market basket of consumer goods and services. This indicator represents the annual growth rate of CPI.\n\n\n\nUnemployment, Total (% of Labor Force):\n\nTotal unemployment is the percentage of the labor force that is unemployed but actively seeking employment.\n\n\n\nLabor Force Participation Rate, Female (% of Female Population Ages 15+):\n\nThe labor force participation rate for females represents the percentage of the female population ages 15 and older that is economically active.\n\n\n\nLabor Force Participation Rate, Male (% of Male Population Ages 15+):\n\nThe labor force participation rate for males represents the percentage of the male population ages 15 and older that is economically active.\n\n\n\n\nLoad Libraries and Packages\nThe libraries used in our analysis are given below:\nThe data set used in our analysis is given below:\n\n\nCode\nworld_bank_data &lt;- readRDS(\"world_bank_data.rds\")\n\noptions(max.print = 15)\n\nkable(world_bank_data, \"html\") %&gt;% kable_styling()\n\n\n\n\n\nCountry\nYear\nPopulation\nGdpPerCapita\nAgeDependancyRatio\nInflation\nUnemploymentRate\nFemaleLaborRate\nMaleLaborRate\n\n\n\n\nEuropean Union\n2018\n447001100\n35751.573\n54.66621\n1.7386086\n7.253803\n51.06276\n63.84818\n\n\nEuropean Union\n2019\n447367191\n35079.534\n55.29177\n1.6305226\n6.679810\n51.26601\n63.91365\n\n\nEuropean Union\n2020\n447692315\n34356.575\n55.86259\n0.4764989\n7.054819\n50.50284\n63.01832\n\n\nEuropean Union\n2021\n447178112\n38721.763\n56.34923\n2.5545070\n7.000430\n51.13162\n63.14634\n\n\nEuropean Union\n2022\n447370510\n37432.560\n56.57327\n8.8336989\n6.098751\n51.88009\n63.83574\n\n\nTurkiye\n2018\n81407204\n9568.836\n46.30621\n16.3324639\n10.890000\n34.03700\n72.43400\n\n\nTurkiye\n2019\n82579440\n9215.441\n46.74186\n15.1768216\n13.670000\n34.21500\n71.76100\n\n\nTurkiye\n2020\n83384680\n8638.739\n46.82812\n12.2789574\n13.110000\n30.76700\n67.99800\n\n\nTurkiye\n2021\n84147318\n9743.213\n46.75508\n19.5964927\n11.980000\n32.76200\n70.13500\n\n\nTurkiye\n2022\n84979913\n10674.504\n46.77459\n72.3088360\n10.030000\n34.16700\n71.11600\n\n\nUkraine\n2018\n44622518\n3096.562\n47.21927\n10.9518559\n8.800000\n49.54200\n64.46000\n\n\nUkraine\n2019\n44386203\n3661.458\n47.75787\n7.8867175\n8.190000\n49.26000\n64.81700\n\n\nUkraine\n2020\n44132049\n3751.737\n48.18610\n2.7324921\n9.480000\n48.15100\n63.44800\n\n\nUkraine\n2021\n43822901\n4827.846\n48.41627\n9.3631392\n9.830000\n47.79100\n62.89700\n\n\nUkraine\n2022\n38000000\n4533.976\n52.05497\n20.1836367\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Findings:\n\nTotal Population Comparison:\nBoth the USA and Turkey experienced steady population growth between 2018 and 2023. The USA had a larger total population compared to Turkey throughout the period.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGDP per Capita Comparison:\nThe USA consistently exhibited a higher GDP per capita compared to Turkey. Both countries showed variations in GDP per capita over the years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAge Dependency Ratio Comparison:\nThe age dependency ratio in Turkey was higher than in the USA, indicating a relatively larger proportion of dependents.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInflation Rate Comparison:\nInflation rates fluctuated in both countries, with specific years potentially warranting further investigation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInflation and GdpPerCapita Change Over Years:\nThe provided code conducts an analysis of the change in Inflation and GDP per Capita over the years for two countries, Turkey (TUR) and the United States (USA). The data is first processed to calculate the percentage change in both Inflation and GDP per Capita compared to the previous year. Two line charts are then generated and displayed vertically.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnemployment Rate Comparison:\nThe Unemployment Rate Comparison analysis reveals that, over the specified years (2018-2023), the USA consistently maintained lower unemployment rates compared to Turkey. The line chart visually depicts the annual fluctuations in the unemployment rates for both countries, with the USA consistently positioned below Turkey. This suggests a relatively more stable employment environment in the USA during the analyzed period, emphasizing the difference in labor market conditions between the two countries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFemale Labor Force Participation Rate Comparison:\nThe labor force participation rate for females showed variations but tended to be higher in the USA compared to Turkey.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMale Labor Force Participation Rate Comparison:\nThe labor force participation rate for males exhibited fluctuations, with both countries experiencing changes over the years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnemployment Rate and Female&Male Force Participation Rate Change Over Years\nThe provided code conducts an analysis of the change in Unemployment Rate andFemale&Male Force Participation Rate over the years for two countries, Turkey (TUR) and the United States (USA). The data is first processed to calculate the percentage change in both Inflation and GDP per Capita compared to the previous year. Three line charts are then generated and displayed vertically.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggplot(world_bank_data, aes(x = factor(Year), y =Inflation , size = GdpPerCapita)) +\n  geom_point(aes(color = Country), alpha = 0.7) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Inflation vs GdpPerCapita by Year and Country\",\n    x = \"Year\",\n    y = \"Inflation\",\n    size = \"GdpPerCapita\",\n    color = \"Country\"\n  ) +\n  scale_size_continuous(range = c(3, 15)) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFurther Analysis:\n\nTrend Analysis: Explore trends in each indicator over the specified period.\nCorrelation Analysis: Investigate potential correlations between different indicators.\nRegional Comparisons: Compare USA and Turkey indicators with each other.\n\nThis Explatory Data Analysis provides an initial overview, and further investigations and statistical tests will be conducted for a more in-depth understanding."

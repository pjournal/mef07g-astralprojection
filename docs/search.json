    "text": "Comparing Two EU Candidates: Ukraine and Turkey\n\nIntroduction:\nIn this Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), we focused on the years 2018 to 2022, we conducted a comparative analysis between two countries, Ukraine and Turkey, both aspiring to become candidates for the European Union. Utilizing key indicators such as total population, GDP per capita, age dependency ratio, inflation, unemployment rate, and gender-specific labor force participation rates, we aimed to evaluate and contrast the socio-economic landscapes of these nations. The data collected from the World Bank allows us to gain insights into the demographic structure, economic performance, and labor dynamics, providing a comprehensive overview of the key factors influencing their candidacy for EU membership. This analysis will contribute to a deeper understanding of the current state and potential trajectories of Ukraine and Turkey in their pursuit of EU accession.\n\n\nDescription of Selected Indicators:\n\nTotal Population:\n\nTotal population is the sum of all residents regardless of age.\n\n\n\nGDP per Capita:\n\nGross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita represents the average economic output per person.\n\n\n\nAge Dependency Ratio:\n\nThe age dependency ratio is the ratio of dependents (those aged 0-14 and 65+) to the working-age population (15-64).\n\n\n\nInflation, Consumer Prices (CPI) Annual Growth Rate:\n\nThe Consumer Price Index (CPI) measures the average change over time in the prices paid by urban consumers for a market basket of consumer goods and services. This indicator represents the annual growth rate of CPI.\n\n\n\nUnemployment, Total (% of Labor Force):\n\nTotal unemployment is the percentage of the labor force that is unemployed but actively seeking employment.\n\n\n\nLabor Force Participation Rate, Female (% of Female Population Ages 15+):\n\nThe labor force participation rate for females represents the percentage of the female population ages 15 and older that is economically active.\n\n\n\nLabor Force Participation Rate, Male (% of Male Population Ages 15+):\n\nThe labor force participation rate for males represents the percentage of the male population ages 15 and older that is economically active.\n\n\n\n\nLoad Libraries and Packages\nThe libraries used in our analysis are given below:\nThe data set used in our analysis is given below:\n\n\nCode\nworld_bank_data &lt;- readRDS(\"world_bank_data.rds\")\n\noptions(max.print = 15)\n\nkable(world_bank_data, \"html\") %&gt;% kable_styling()\n\n\n\n\n\nCountry\nYear\nPopulation\nGdpPerCapita\nAgeDependancyRatio\nInflation\nUnemploymentRate\nFemaleLaborRate\nMaleLaborRate\n\n\n\n\nEuropean Union\n2018\n447001100\n35751.573\n54.66621\n1.7386086\n7.253803\n51.06276\n63.84818\n\n\nEuropean Union\n2019\n447367191\n35079.534\n55.29177\n1.6305226\n6.679810\n51.26601\n63.91365\n\n\nEuropean Union\n2020\n447692315\n34356.575\n55.86259\n0.4764989\n7.054819\n50.50284\n63.01832\n\n\nEuropean Union\n2021\n447178112\n38721.763\n56.34923\n2.5545070\n7.000430\n51.13162\n63.14634\n\n\nEuropean Union\n2022\n447370510\n37432.560\n56.57327\n8.8336989\n6.098751\n51.88009\n63.83574\n\n\nTurkiye\n2018\n81407204\n9568.836\n46.30621\n16.3324639\n10.890000\n34.03700\n72.43400\n\n\nTurkiye\n2019\n82579440\n9215.441\n46.74186\n15.1768216\n13.670000\n34.21500\n71.76100\n\n\nTurkiye\n2020\n83384680\n8638.739\n46.82812\n12.2789574\n13.110000\n30.76700\n67.99800\n\n\nTurkiye\n2021\n84147318\n9743.213\n46.75508\n19.5964927\n11.980000\n32.76200\n70.13500\n\n\nTurkiye\n2022\n84979913\n10674.504\n46.77459\n72.3088360\n10.030000\n34.16700\n71.11600\n\n\nUkraine\n2018\n44622518\n3096.562\n47.21927\n10.9518559\n8.800000\n49.54200\n64.46000\n\n\nUkraine\n2019\n44386203\n3661.458\n47.75787\n7.8867175\n8.190000\n49.26000\n64.81700\n\n\nUkraine\n2020\n44132049\n3751.737\n48.18610\n2.7324921\n9.480000\n48.15100\n63.44800\n\n\nUkraine\n2021\n43822901\n4827.846\n48.41627\n9.3631392\n9.830000\n47.79100\n62.89700\n\n\nUkraine\n2022\n38000000\n4533.976\n52.05497\n20.1836367\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Findings:\n\nTotal Population Comparison:\nWhile the European Union’s population remains stable, Turkey demonstrates a steady increase, and Ukraine experiences fluctuations with a notable decline in 2022.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(scales)\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggplot(world_bank_data, aes(x = factor(Year), y = Population / 1e6, fill = Country)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", position = \"dodge\", alpha = 0.7) +\n  geom_text(aes(label = scales::label_number_si(accuracy = 1)(Population)), \n            position = position_dodge(width = 0.9), \n            vjust = -0.5, \n            size = 3) +\n  labs(title = \"Total Population Comparison\",\n       x = \"Year\",\n       y = \"Population (Million)\",\n       fill = \"Country\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::label_number_si(accuracy = 1)) + \n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGDP per Capita Comparison:\nThe GDP per Capita Comparison graph highlights distinct economic trends for each country/region.

In the EU, there is a gradual decrease in population alongside a decline in GDP per capita. Age dependency ratios are consistently high, indicating an aging population, while inflation and unemployment rates fluctuate. Female and male labor rates remain relatively stable.\nFor Turkey, the population shows a slight increase, but there is a noticeable drop in GDP per capita. Age dependency ratios and inflation rates vary, with a significant spike in 2022. Unemployment rates decrease over the period, and female and male labor rates exhibit moderate fluctuations.\nIn the case of Ukraine, the population decreases notably from 2018 to 2022, possibly due to recent geopolitical events. GDP per capita follows an upward trend, and age dependency ratios remain relatively stable. Inflation rates fluctuate, while unemployment rates decrease. It’s worth noting that data for 2022 is incomplete for Ukraine. Overall, these trends suggest varying economic and demographic dynamics across the three entities over the analyzed period."
